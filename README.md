# Depression-Classifier-using-Text-Mining
Mental illness has been prevalent in the world; depression is one of the most common psychological problems. With the use of the large amount of data tweets and Facebook post online we can use machine learning to data mine it and be able to produce a meaningful and useful outcome. Social media generates countless data every day because of millions of active users share and communicate in entire community, it changes human interaction. For this project, we will be using Python and various modules and libraries.

Twitter rapidly has become one of the most popular social media since it launched, it advises 313 million active users who produce 6,000 tweets on Twitter every second as June, 20161. In favour of gathering the depression related data, we keep monitoring each streaming tweet that includes the word “depression” in entire Twitter community. Totally, we have gathered about 54-million of tweets that discussed the depression relevant field.

The aim of the project is to predict early signs of depression through Social Media text mining. Below are the steps to run the python codes using the data sets uploaded in the repositories or you can download on your own using a Twitter Developer Account.
